# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These are placeholder files. For a production extension, you would need actual PNG icon files.

You can create icons using:
- Online tools like Canva, Figma, or Photoshop
- Icon generators like realfavicongenerator.net
- Free icon libraries like Heroicons or Feather Icons

The icons should represent a shield or security theme to match the phishing protection functionality.
